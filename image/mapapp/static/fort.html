                Vellore Fort, built in the 16th century by the Vijayanagara Empire, is a 133-acre granite structure known for its robust architecture and the unique presence of a Hindu temple, mosque, and church within its walls. It later served as a significant site for the British East India Company, where the Vellore Mutiny of 1806, the first major uprising against British rule, occurred.
